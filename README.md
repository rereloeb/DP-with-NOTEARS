# DP with NOTEARS

Go to the directory ./notears/

The main file to run is the nonlinear.py file.
The bash file simulations_CLI.sh shows examples on how to use nonlinear.py with command line instructions (output files are sent to ./notears/outputs/).
The python file simulation1.py calls nonlinear.py via a function.

This repo implements the ideas from the following article:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13189
and makes the method differentially private.
